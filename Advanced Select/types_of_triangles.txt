Problem:Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Solution: 
    SELECT 
        CASE 
          WHEN (A+B<=C)
             THEN 'Not A Triangle' 
          WHEN (A=B AND B=C AND C=A)
             THEN 'Equilateral'  
          WHEN (A=B AND A<>C) OR (A=C AND B<>C) OR (B=C AND C<>A)
             THEN 'Isosceles'
          WHEN (A<>B AND B<>C  AND C<>A)
             THEN 'Scalene'
        END     
        FROM TRIANGLES;
