problem: Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

solution:   SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) 
            FROM STATION 
            WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345
            ORDER BY LAT_N DESC LIMIT 1;
